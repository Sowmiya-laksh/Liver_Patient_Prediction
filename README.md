> # Liver_Patient_Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict liver diseases using various machine learning classifiers. The dataset includes patient records from the North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The goal is to build a predictive model to assist in reducing the burden on doctors by accurately identifying liver patients based on clinical attributes.

### Problem Statement
#### Task 1:
Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given dataset.

#### Task 2:
a) Implement different classifiers to predict liver diseases.\
b) Analyze the basis for model design and feature importance.

#### Task 3:
Provide a comparison of the models and suggest the most suitable model for production.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains 583 patient records, with 416 liver disease cases and 167 non-liver disease cases. The target variable, "Target," indicates whether a patient has a liver disease (1) or not (2). The dataset features various clinical attributes such as bilirubin levels, enzyme measurements, and protein levels.

### Key Attributes:
- *Age* : Age of the patient
- *Gender* : Gender of the patient
- *Total Bilirubin* : Bilirubin content in the blood
- *Direct Bilirubin* : Direct bilirubin content
- *Alkaline Phosphotase* : Alkaline phosphatase enzyme level
- *Alamine Aminotransferase* : Alamine aminotransferase enzyme level
- *Aspartate Aminotransferase* : Aspartate aminotransferase enzyme level
- *Total Proteins* : Total protein content
- *Albumin* : Albumin protein level
- *Albumin and Globulin Ratio* : Ratio between albumin and globulin
- *Target* : Class label for liver disease (1: patient with liver disease, 2: patient with no liver disease)

### Solution Approach
- *Data Analysis and Preprocessing*: Handle missing values and ensure data is cleaned for accurate analysis.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Perform a detailed analysis of the relationship between clinical attributes and liver disease diagnosis.
- *Modeling*: Implement various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines to predict liver disease.
- *Model Comparison*: Evaluate and compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- *Model Selection*: Recommend the best model for production based on performance and interpretability.

### Challenges Faced
- Managing class imbalance, as there are more liver disease cases than non-liver cases.
- Handling potential outliers in clinical measurements.
- Optimizing hyperparameters for the classifiers to achieve the best performance.

### Practice Skills
- Feature engineering
- Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM
- Model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation
- Data visualization for healthcare analytics

### Model Comparison Report
This section includes a report comparing the performance of multiple classifiers (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). The best-performing model will be recommended based on overall evaluation metrics.

### Conclusion
This project serves as a practical solution for early detection of liver disease using machine learning, aiming to alleviate the workload on healthcare professionals by providing a reliable, data-driven tool for diagnosis.
